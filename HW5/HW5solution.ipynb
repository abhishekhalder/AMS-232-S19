    "Consider the vertical (1D) descent of a spacecraft onto the lunar surface. The descent phase starts at $t=0$, and the touchdown happens at (free) final time $t=T$. Because of the lack of atomosphere, the spacecraft needs to use thrust to negate free fall due to gravity, and thereby ensure soft landing. \n",

Let $h(t)$ be the altitude of the spacecraft above the lunar surface at time $t$. From Newton's law (force balance), we have\n",
