    "The **fourth possibility** (full thrust then free-fall), is also impossible since the post-switching (i.e., free-fall) phase mandates $\\dot{x}_2 < 0$; thus to satisfy $x_2(T)=0$ we need $x_2(t) > 0$ during the pre-switching (full thrust) phase. Consequently, $\\dot{x}_1 > 0$ in pre-switching phase, meaning that we cannot satisfy the terminal condition $x_1(T)=0$ unless $x_1(t) < 0$ for some $t$ in the post-switching phase.
