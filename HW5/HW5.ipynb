    "Consider the vertical (1D) descent of a spacecraft onto the lunar surface. The descent phase starts at $t=0$, and the touchdown happens at (free) final time $t=T$. Due to the lack of atomosphere, the spacecraft needs to use thrust to negate free fall due to gravity, and thereby ensure soft landing. \n",

    "Let $g$ be the constant (lunar) acceleration due to gravity during the descent. Suppose the mass of the fuel at time $t$ is $m(t)$, which changes over $0\\leq t \\leq T$ since the fuel is burnt to generate the thrust $\\tau = -k\\dot{m}$, where the velocity of exhaust gas w.r.t. the spacecraft is a constant $k>0$. Let $h(t)$ be the altitude of the spacecraft above the lunar surface at time $t$. From Newton's law (force balance), we have\n",

Here, the control $u$ is the rate of fuel consumption, i.e., $\\dot{m} = u$. The engine imposes the constraint: $-\\alpha \\leq u \\leq 0$, for some known constant $\\alpha>0$.\n",
